# jule-gamedev

This organization was made by me, [SabeDoesThings](https://github.com/SabeDoesThings), for any easy for him and maybe other to put in language bindings for the [Jule](https://jule.dev/) programming language for anything game development related.
(I think of as [arewegameyet?](https://arewegameyet.rs/) for the Rust programming language)
